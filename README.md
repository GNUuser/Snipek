# Snipek
SailfishOS app that converts phone into remote microphone and speaker for Snips voice assistant system

Snips (https://snips.ai/) provides voice assistant system that doesnâ€™t require external cloud service. All processing (including voice) is entirely done locally, on device where Snips is installed.

Snipek acts as remote microphone and speaker. It connects to Snips as an additional audio server. It sends audio stream captured from the microphone and plays audio files received from the Snips system. At this moment Snips supports installation on Raspberry Pi 3 (but it works also on Raspberry Pi 2) and Debian system. Snipek was tested on both platforms and it works with almost zero configuration effort.

## Desktop
Because Sinipek is written in C++/Qt it can be easily ported to any platform that supports Qt. As an experiment, Linux desktop version is also available in following binary packages:
- DEB (tested on Ubuntu 18.04)
- RPM (tested on Fedora 28 and OpenSuse Leap 15.0)
- Arch Linux

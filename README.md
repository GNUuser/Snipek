# Snipek
Remote microphone and speaker for Snips voice assistant system

## Description
Snipek is a Linux desktop and [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/) app that converts phone into remote microphone and speaker for [Snips](https://snips.ai/) voice assistant system.

Snips provides voice assistant system that doesnâ€™t require external cloud service. All processing (including voice) is entirely done locally, on device where Snips is installed.

Snipek app acts as remote microphone and speaker. It connects to Snips as an additional audio server. It sends audio stream captured from the microphone and plays audio files received from Snips system. At this moment Snips supports installation on Raspberry Pi 3 (but it works also on Raspberry Pi 2) and Debian desktop. App was tested on both platforms and it works with almost zero configuration effort.
